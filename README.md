# brancher
Create branch names from Jira ticket URL
``` 
ticket/ABC-123-ticket-title-slug
```
It is a demonstration of how to add content to a page via chrome extension content-script. 

# How it works?
It checks if the active tab URL is atlassian.net and has ticketID, then adds the ticket information on the header.

> This doesn't use any external libraries or packages.
